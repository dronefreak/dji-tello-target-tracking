### Changed

- **Detection Method**: HSV color masking â†’ YOLOv8 deep learning
- **Tracking**: Basic centroid â†’ Advanced multi-object tracking with prediction
- **Control**: Manual tuning â†’ Auto-tuned PID control
- **Code Structure**: Single files â†’ Modular package structure
- **Dependencies**: Minimal â†’ Modern Python stack (PyTorch, ultralytics)
- **Python Version**: 3.6 â†’ 3.8+ (type hints, dataclasses)

### Improved

- **Performance**:
  - 30-120 FPS depending on model and hardware (vs ~15 FPS)
  - GPU acceleration support
  - Optimized tracking algorithms
- **Accuracy**:
  - YOLOv8 mAP@50: 0.50-0.65 (vs HSV: N/A)
  - Robust to lighting conditions
  - Works with any detectable object (not just colored balls)
- **Stability**:
  - Handles temporary occlusions
  - Smooth trajectory following
  - Graceful error handling
- **User Experience**:
  - Interactive controls
  - Real-time feedback
  - Easy configuration
  - Better documentation

### Removed

- Legacy HSV-only tracking (now available as fallback)
- TelloPy dependency (replaced with djitellopy)
- imutils dependency (replaced with native OpenCV)
- pynput dependency (using OpenCV key handling)
- av dependency (using djitellopy's built-in stream handling)

### Fixed

- Tracking loss on fast movements
- Control lag issues
- Video stream stability
- Battery monitoring reliability

### Security

- Added security policy and vulnerability reporting process
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Input validation for drone commands
- Safe default configurations

### Breaking Changes

- Complete API rewrite - not backward compatible with v1.0
- Different file structure
- New dependencies
- Configuration format changed

### Migration Guide from v1.0

**Detection:**

```python
# Old (v1.0)
from tracker import Tracker
tracker = Tracker(height, width, green_lower, green_upper)

# New (v2.0)
from src.config import Config
from src.detector import ObjectDetector
config = Config()
detector = ObjectDetector(config)
```

**Tracking:**

```python
# Old (v1.0)
tracker.track(frame)

# New (v2.0)
detections = detector.detect(frame)
tracker.update(detections)
```

**Drone Control:**

```python
# Old (v1.0)
import tellopy
drone = tellopy.Tello()

# New (v2.0)
from src.drone_controller import DroneController
from src.config import get_drone_config
config, drone_config = get_drone_config()
drone = DroneController(config, drone_config)
```

## [1.0.0] - 2020-XX-XX

### Initial Release

- HSV color-based object detection
- Basic centroid tracking for green objects
- Manual drone control with keyboard
- Basic video streaming from Tello
- Simple tracking algorithm
- Minimal documentation
